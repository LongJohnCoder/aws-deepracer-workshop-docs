# Deploying ROS Applications 
In the next activity, you will deploy the JetBot application code to a physical robot. As your workshop instructor mentioned, we will be working in groups for this activity. Get together with your group and pick up an NVidia JetBot. When a robot application is deployed to a physical robot, AWS RoboMaker does the following:

- AWS RoboMaker creates or updates a custom Lambda in your account. The Lambda contains the logic needed for deployment. This includes robot application bundle download, ROS launch, pre- and post-checks, and other logic.
- AWS RoboMaker begins deployment to the fleet using the parallelization specified in the deployment configuration.
- AWS RoboMaker notifies AWS IoT Greengrass to run the custom Lambda on the target robot. The daemon running on the robot receives the command and runs the Lambda. If a Lambda is running when the command is received, it and all ROS process on the robot are terminated.
- The Lambda downloads and uncompresses the robot application bundle from Amazon S3. If a pre-launch script was specified, it is run. Then the Lambda starts ROS using the launch file and package specified. If a post-launch script was specified, it is run after ROS is started. Finally, the status of the deployment is updated.

### Prepare Your ROS Application for Deployment

The NVidia Jetson Nano Developer Kit has an **arm64** architecture. Therefore, to prepare the application to deploy and launch on our JetBot, we need to build and bundle the ROS Application for arm64. To do this, we will use a docker image we prepared to **cross compile** the application.

1. Open the RoboMaker IDE and navigate to the terminal

1. In the terminal window, change to the `jetbot/assets` directory and run the install script.

    ``` 
    # Run install_dep.sh to install prerequisite 
    $ cd ~/environment/jetbot/assets/scripts 
    $ sudo ./configure_docker.sh
    ``` 

    - **What is happening here?** This shell script (install_deps.sh) is going to setup a few key dependencies for us today. It will:
      - Install **QEMU** emulator for cross compiling **arm64** applications.
      - Build a **docker image** for us to cross compile the ROS application for the physical robot in Activity 2. This image is based on the **NVidia Jetson Nano** filesystem and makes it easy to complile the ROS application for your **JetBot**.

1. **IMPORTANT**: Change to the **jetbot** directory and build & bundle the ROS application in a docker container.
    ```
    # Make sure you are in the jetbot directory
    $ cd ~/environment/jetbot
    ```

1. Next, start a docker container with the following command. This will enable you to run commands inside the docker container once running. *Note: if you see a permission denied error in container shell, it is safe to ignore and continue.*

    ```
    # IMPORTANT: Make sure you are in the jetbot directory
    # Build and bundle the robot application
    $ docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/environment/jetbot jetbot-ros
    ```

1. To cross compile the application for arm64, run the script `compile_arm64.sh`. 

    ```
    # You will be dropped into the shell of the docker container
    # If you see a permission denied error, it is safe to ignore and continue

    (docker)$ ./assets/scripts/compile_arm64.sh 

    # Wait until shell script is completed 
    #Type exit or Ctrl-D, to exit the container
    (docker)$ exit
    ```

    - **What is happening here?** The compile_arm64.sh script simply runs a ros dependency (rosdep) update and install to collect and build any dependencies. Next, it runs the build commands `colcon` and `colcon bundle`. If you want, open it up and check it out.

1. Open *roboMakerSettings.json* file located in the root folder under RoboMaker IDE folder pane. Look for **s3Bucket** and write down the name of the bucket. It will look similar to *mod-47118164636e49dc-s3bucket-1t252d6l3fmil*. You will need this for next step to upload the compiled and bundled ARM64 ROS application. Also find and write down the value in IOT_ENDPOINT, you will need it when deploying the application to the JetBot.

![S3 and IoT Endpoint](../../images/s3-iot-endpoint.png)

1. Back in the RoboMaker IDE and navigate to the terminal. *Note: Make sure you exited out of the container in previous step.*
    ```
    # Make sure you exited out of the container in previous step
    # Copy the robot application to S3
    $ aws s3 cp ./robot_ws/arm64_bundle/output.tar s3://<S3-BUCKET-NAME>/jetbot/aarch64/output.tar
    ```

Congratulations! Now, you should have an arm64 bundle (output.tar) of your ROS application ready to deploy.  Next, we will configure our Robot Application and Robot in AWS RoboMaker.

### Create a Robot Application

1. Open the AWS RoboMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/

1. In the left pane, choose **Development**, and then choose **Robot Applications**.

1. Select **Create Robot Application**.

1. In the *Create Robot Application* page, type in a **name** for the robot application. Choose a name that helps you identify the robot application.

1. Select the Robot software suite used by your robot application
    * Select *ROS Melodic*

1. Provide the Amazon S3 path to your bundled robot application file in **ARM64 source file** field. Click **Browse S3** and locate the tar file that you uploaded in previous step, `s3://S3-BUCKET-NAME/jetbot/aarch64/output.tar`. Click Create.

1. Open the **Robot Application** you just created. This will open the application details page. Choose **Create New Version**, and then choose **Create**.

### Create a Robot

1. Return to the RoboMaker Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Fleet Management**, and then choose **Robots**.

1. Choose **Create Robot**.

1. In the **Create Robot** page, type a name for the robot.

1. Select the *Architecture* of the robot. Select **ARM64 architecture**, which is the architecture of the JetBot.

1. Under **AWS IoT Greengrass** group defaults, select *Create New* to create a new AWS IoT Greengrass group for the robot.

    *Optionally, you can select an existing AWS IoT Greengrass group. Each robot must have its own AWS IoT Greengrass group.*

    1. If you use an existing AWS IoT Greengrass group, it must have an IAM role associated with it. To create the role, see Create deployment role.

1. Select the *existing IAM role* to assign to the AWS IoT Greengrass group created for the robot. It grants permissions for AWS IoT Greengrass to access your robot application in Amazon S3 and read update status from AWS RoboMaker.

1. Choose **Create**.

1. In the **Download Your Core Device** page, choose **Download** to download the zip file which includes your robot's security resources.

### Configure Robot with Certificates

AWS RoboMaker uses X.509 certificates, managed subscriptions, AWS IoT policies, and IAM policies & roles to secure the applications that run on robots in your deployment environment.

An AWS RoboMake robot is also a Greengrass core. Core devices use certificates and policies to securely connect to AWS IoT. The certificates and policies also allow AWS IoT Greengrass to deploy configuration information, Lambda functions, connectors, and managed subscriptions to core devices

1. On your local machine, open a terminal and navigate to the location of the dowloaded security resources from the previous step.

1. Locate the IP address of robot on the OLED
![waveshare oled](../../images/waveshare-oled.png)

1. Open the local Jypter server by typing this into your web browswer: `https://<IP_ADDRESS>:8888`.

1. In this browser, you will be able to easily acccess the filesystem on the **JetBot**. Select **Upload** to upload your downloaded keys to the JetBot. 

1. Next, open a **terminal** and copy the keys to your greengrass folder. The password for su is "**jetbot**".

    ```
    # Switch to the root user (password is "jetbot")
    $ sudo su

    # Unzip the jetbot security credentials to greengrass certificate store
    $ unzip /home/jetbot/<greengrass-certs>.zip -d /greengrass
    
    # update the CA certificate used by RoboMaker
    $ cd /greengrass/certs/
    $ wget -O root.ca.pem https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem
    
    # start greengrass core
    $ sudo /greengrass/ggc/core/greengrassd start
    ```

### Clean-up Reminder

**Note for those running in their own AWS accounts and are not using a workshop code:**

In this activity, you created a some resources (Development environment, CloudWatch logs, and S3 objects) that incure cost. If you **are not continuing** on with the next sections of the workshop, remember to go to the [clean-up steps](https://www.robomakerworkshops.com/workshop/cleanup/) and remove these resources to stop any potential costs for occurring.
