title: "Finding Martians with AWS RoboMaker and the JPL Open Source Rover"
chapter: true
weight: 0
description: "In this workshop you become familiar with AWS RoboMaker, a service that enables you to easily develop, simulate and deploy intelligent robot applications that integrate with AWS services. This includes AWS machine learning services, monitoring services, and analytics services that enable a robot to stream data, navigate, communicate, comprehend, and learn. Today, you will simulate the <a href='https://opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov/#!/home'>JPL Mars Open Source Rover</a>, and we'll demonstrate the application on a physical robot.
<br><br>
RoboMaker extends the most widely used open-source robotics software framework <strong>Robot Operating System</strong>, or <a href='http://www.ros.org'>ROS</a>. Therefore, this workshop will include references to ROS concepts and tools. No previous ROS experience is required, however, if you would like to learn more check out the <a href='http://www.ros.org'>ROS</a>."
addendum: "Please read through and complete each activity before starting the next. If something doesn't look correct, ask for assistance as we want to make sure the concept covered are well understood.
<br><br>
Excited to build a Martian-finding Mars rover robot using AWS? Let's get started!"
