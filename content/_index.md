# AWS Robotics Day with RoboMaker

Welcome Robot Builders! 

In this workshop you become familiar with AWS RoboMaker, a service that enables you to easily develop, simulate and deploy intelligent robot applications that integrate with AWS services. This includes AWS machine learning services, monitoring services, and analytics services that enable a robot to stream data, navigate, communicate, comprehend, and learn. Today, you will also get hands on with a physical robot (Robotis TurtleBot 3 Burger) to learn how to manage and deploy robot applications to production robots using AWS RoboMaker.

RoboMaker extends the most widely used open-source robotics software framework **Robot Operating System**, or [ROS](http://www.ros.org/). Therefore, this workshop will include references to ROS concepts and tools. No previous ROS experience is required, however, if you would like to learn more check out the [ROS website](http://www.ros.org/).
