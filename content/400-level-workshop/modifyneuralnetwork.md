title: "Update the neural network architecture"
chapter: true
weight: 15
description: "We have partnered with Intel and use Coach as reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we are using Tensorflow as our deep learning framework.

The neural network architecture typically includes an input embedder, middleware, and an output head, see descriptions here. In this section we are interested in changing the middleware."

# Update Middleware

## Configure the RL algorithm hyperparameters

## Configure the reward function

## Configure the action space

## Copy custom files to S3 bucket so that Amazon SageMaker and AWS RoboMaker can pick them up
