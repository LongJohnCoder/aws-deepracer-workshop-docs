# Train the RL model

### Train the RL model using the Python SDK Script mode

Next, we define the following algorithm metrics that we want to capture from cloudwatch logs to monitor the training progress. These are algorithm specific parameters and might change for different algorithm. We use Clipped PPO for this example.

### Create the Kinesis video stream (optional)

### Create Simulation Application

Blurb about creating the simapp in AWS RoboMaker

### Upload your customized simulation application to your s3 bucket

The AWS DeepRacer bundle to be used by the AWS RoboMaker service is under build/output.tar.gz. Next, we need to upload the bundle to our S3 bucket and create an AWS RoboMaker Simulation Application.



### Create arn for the AWS RoboMaker simulation application
